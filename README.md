# meeting-picker

## Usage

Put availability data in `data.tsv` and run: `node meeting-picker.js`

You can also pass an argument for how many meeting slots you want selected:
`node meeting-picker.js 4`

TODO: Explain this better (like how to create and format data.tsv, and what the
output looks like and means.)
